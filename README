The complete code base for both server and client side includes the following 
class files: FileClient.class, FileServer.class, FileServerImpl.class, 
FileInfo.class, FileOp.class. For deployment, it is better to wrap up the 
needed the class files into jar package. For client side, wrap the following classes:

jar cvf Client.jar FileInfo.class
jar uvf Client.jar FileOp.class
jar uvf Client.jar FileServer.class
jar uvf Client.jar FileClient.class
jar uvf Client.jar FileServerImpl.class

The server side jar can be created in a similar way. For each jar package, create a manifest 
file specifying the main class. For client jar, put a single line: Main-Class: FileClient 
in the manifest file and add the file into the jar package.
jar cvfm Client.jar manifest Put the corresponding jar files to designated machines. At the 
server side, bind the server to a registry first.
